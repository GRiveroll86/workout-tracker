## Description
This assignment asked us to create an application to track workouts using Node, Express and MongoDB and deploy the application with Heroku. The first page will show your last workout and give you two options; Continue Workout or New Workout. The first option will allow you to add an exercise to your last workout while the second option allows you to start a new workout. From either option you will need to choose what type of workout, cardio or resistance. Once the input fields have been filled in you can choose to add the workout or complete it.
